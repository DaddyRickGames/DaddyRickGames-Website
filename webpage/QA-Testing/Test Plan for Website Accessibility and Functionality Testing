1. Introduction
    This test plan outlines the approach for verifying the website's accessible color system, menu bar functionality, and dark mode switch. It aims to ensure these features are implemented correctly to enhance user experience and accessibility.

2. Test Items
    Accessible Color System: 
        Ensures the website uses color schemes that provide sufficient 
        contrast and are accessible to users with visual impairments.
        Checking if in Light Mode these colors are accessible.
        #134266 Dark Blue
        #3ca4c8 Light Blue
        #e7b7b0 Peach Color
        And again if they are accessible in dark mode.

    Menu Bar Functionality
        Ensures the menu bar is functional, responsive, and accessible through both mouse and keyboard navigation.
            Ensure each item takes you even if its a empty page
            to the correct html page.
            Pages are.

    Dark Mode Switch
        Ensures the dark mode switch effectively toggles the website between dark and light themes without affecting usability.
        Make sure the text for Dark Mode is sitting correctly in comparison to where it opens at.

3. Features to be Tested
    Color contrast ratios against WCAG 2.2 Guidelines
    Readability of text and visibility of UI elements in different color modes.
    Menu bar visibility, interactivity, and navigation efficiency
    Dark mode and light mode switching functionality and effect on website aesthetics and readability

4. Features Not to Be Tested
    Detailed functionality of linked pages from the menu bar items, except for their ability to be navigated to
    Browser-specific color rendering, except for major browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge
    User preferences saving for color modes across sessions (unless specified as a requirement)

5. Approach
    Tools and Techniques
        Use automated tools for color contrast analysis (E.g. WebAIM Contrast Checker)
        Manual testing with screen readers (e.g. NVDA JAWS) for accessibility verification
        Browser developer tools for responsive design testing
        Keyboard navigation to ensure accessibility for non-mouse users
    Testing Types
        Accessibility testing: To ensure the website meets accessibility standards
        Functional Testing: To verify the menu bar and dark mode switch work as expected
        Usability Testing: To assess the user experience in navigating the website and using its freatures

6. Pass/Fail Criteria
    Pass: The feature meets all outlined requirements, including WCAG 2.1 color contrast ratios, functional navigation through the menu and seamless switching between dark and light modes
    Fail: The feature does not meet one or more of the outlined requirements, indicating issues with accessibility, functionality, or usability

7. Testing Schedule
    Preparation phase: Review of website design and requirements, setup of testing tools and environment
    Execution Phase: Conducting test according to this plan, including automated and manual testing
    Reporting Phase: Documentation of findings, reporting bugs/issues, and recommendations

8. Deliverables
    Testcases and scripts
    Test results report, including bugs and issues found
    Recommendations for improvements based on test findings

9. Testing Environment
    Website will be locally tested
    Desktop Accessibility
    Required sotfware tools for accessibility testing and screen reading

10. Risks and Mitigations
    Risk Inadequate tooling for comprehensive accessibility testing
        Mitigation: Research and utilize a combination of the best available tools and manual testing practices
    Risk: Changes in website design or functionality during Testing
        Mitigation: Ensure close communication with the development team to stay informed of any changes. (I am the whole crew)
